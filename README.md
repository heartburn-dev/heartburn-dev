# Toby Jackson

I enjoy helping create a safer digital future for all, especially in times of extreme change. Temporarily on a hiatus to focus on upskilling in areas I see as the most pivotal in the coming 5 years: AI and Cloud. 
Ex technical lead and SME focused on network penetration testing with a healthy drizzle of web assessments. 

Love solving problems and just taking the learning journey one day at a time!
